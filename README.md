# English-to-Chinese Translator Using LSTM-Based Seq2Seq Architecture

This project implements a basic English-to-Chinese translator using a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in TensorFlow and Keras.

## üìå Overview

The model takes English sentences as input and learns to generate corresponding Chinese translations using a neural encoder-decoder structure. It demonstrates core concepts of neural machine translation (NMT), including sequence encoding, decoding, and evaluation using BLEU score.
